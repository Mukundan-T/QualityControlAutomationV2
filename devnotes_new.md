# Refactoring development notes

* Should 'undated', 'none' etc be valid for the date column? In which case I can attempt formatting and leave all else - i.e. don't have to highlight errors if it won't lead to an upload error

* Could really do with a cleanup of the date checks. The filename checks are now a lot more pallateable, date checks need to be just as readable
